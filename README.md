### welcome to the baldnate github experience

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a fully automated, always on informational experience called _the vortex_.  See it live on [twitch](twitch.tv/baldnate).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything needed to continue development of the vortex.  I also occasionally work on support software for speedrunning retrogames.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate an open-source non-hosted replacement for StreamLabs Twitch events and StreamLabels.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with sustainable interfaces to live, public domain data (ex: weather data from NWS).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about OBS automation, pixel pushing in HTML, test and measurement, speedrunning, particle I/O, and arduino.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: baldnate makes his own Central Texas style BBQ, and also his own kimchi.
